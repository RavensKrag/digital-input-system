above sequences seem pretty easy to create a nice clean interface for
the "sequence" type is different though,
because the whole point is being able to list specific times between button presses


how do you find a down event?
	find the sequences needed to trigger the even
but when you want to fight an up event
	you need to look for both the down and the up sequences back to back
	
	NO
	
	if you do that, then holding down a sequence, and then hitting bunch of other keys
		which would clease a large chunk of the buffer
	would prevent detecting of an up event


maybe the sequence requested to be searched by the event tracker should change
from the button down sequence to the button up sequence
depending on the state of the event tracker?


question:
	want to detct
		chord(ABC) -> chord(BCD)
	actual input is
		chord(ABC) -> B -> chord(BCD)
	but the chords hit at expected times
	is the input valid, or not, and why?
answer:
	???




accelerator(shift) + click
	accelerators are OR detection, rather than the AND detection usually used on :press test
	well, not OR, because that would fire on any
	rather, non-sequential AND
	
	--- does it matter at all what the order is?
	when you talk about accelerators, it feels like (example) shift is auxilerry, and click is main
	but the whole accelerator pattern only fires when the whole thing is compelete
	so does it matter what order you look for these things?
	
	AND relations can short-circuit if only one of the things is false
	is there a particular order to accelerator patterns that will help with short-circuiting?
	
	
	POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION
	
	put all evens in a hash
	when you match any event in the hash
	take the value, and set it to true
	run Hash#all? to see if :press event fires
	
	-> gets complicated when you have Sequences as triggers, rather than simple events




complex(a, b, c) + simple
analogous to
[a, b, c] + d
might just be easier to do
[a, b, c] + [d]
and be done with it
not sure though if the user of the library should be forced to do that conversion manually

though... for numbers, auto-conversion is standard


if you wrap like this, it becomes just a matter of checking if all sequences are active






---------------------------------------------
---- how should edge trigger be handled? ----
---------------------------------------------
Strategy A
	tick		press			hold only triggers if the button is held for more than one tick
	tick		hold			
	tick		hold			
	
	
	or

Strategy B	
	tick		press			hold triggers after the edge transition
				hold			
	tick		hold			
	tick		hold			





complex events can't fire press until next tick
because #trigger_press? doesn't actually fire transition
it basically just queues the transition

so the transition has not taken effect when the complex is evaluated
it WILL have taken effect on the next input tick

thus, you have the perceived off-by-one error


this is a problem with refusing to transition,
in order to prevent callbacks
	perhaps solution is to fully separate transitions from whether or not callbacks fire?

no, rather

need to transition to edge on press for complex events to trigger
need to cancel events back so they don't execute in the #update




solution:
	Use Strategy A for handeling edge triggers as seen above
	this is accomplished by spliting state machine from 2 states into 4 states
	also, running callbacks only on #update, rather than immediately after Event is processed
	
	This requires implementing input canceling,
	but the valence shell algorithm uses canceling as part of it's mark/unmark system, so it's fine
	canceling is just bad if it's some weird cludgy thing




current accelerator issues
	chord can trigger while mouse_and_keyboard is running, but single can't
	^ don't remember this being a thing...



Issue: 
	*	Accelerator has false negative (fires the release at weird time)
		if any other key is released, (even ones not in the accelerator pattern)
		then the accelerator will release
		
	*	accelerator not active when pattern breaks
		shift (hold) -> click -> click -> click -> shift (release)
		each click should fire the shift_click event, but only the first one does
Solution:
	accelerator changed to restore the sub-inputs it canceled during start up
	
	alternative is to somehow guard against occluded events firing.
	thought about testing in #update,
	but that would require occlusion testing every frame, rather than only on state change
		(probably would only care about :active and :idle)
		(you want to allow for state transitions, so the edge states must update)
	
	#push used rather than just setting state, as jumping states could result in strange behavior
